Iris Dataset Exploration and Visualization
Task Objective

The objective of this task is to learn how to load, inspect, and visualize a dataset in order to understand its structure, distributions, and relationships between features. This task focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python libraries.

Dataset Used

Name: Iris Dataset

Format: CSV (loaded using pandas)

Description:
The Iris dataset contains measurements of iris flowers belonging to three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

Features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

Species (target/class)

Models Applied

No machine learning models were applied in this task.

This task is purely focused on data loading, inspection, descriptive statistics, and visualization.

Key Results and Findings

The dataset contains 150 rows and 5 columns with no missing values.

Summary statistics revealed clear differences in petal length and petal width among the three species.

Scatter plots showed strong separation between species when using petal-related features.

Histograms helped visualize the distribution and range of each feature.

Box plots revealed that:

Petal measurements vary significantly across species.

No extreme outliers significantly affect the dataset.

Overall, the dataset is clean, well-structured, and suitable for further machine learning tasks.

Tools & Libraries Used

pandas – data loading and inspection

matplotlib – basic plotting

seaborn – enhanced visualizations

Conclusion

This task provided hands-on experience with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and demonstrated how visualization techniques help uncover patterns and insights in data before applying machine learning models.
